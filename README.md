# Jenkins PHP Template

##Template for Jenkins jobs for PHP projects.

This is actually a copy of [Sebastian Bergmann template](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-jenkins-template), but with Phing as a build tool.
 
See also my [Zend Framework 2 Skeleton](https://github.com/jakubigla/zf2-skeleton), that works with this template perfectly.
